The information contained in the article below is written here instead
of the individual [manuals](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink") for each profession
because this is all information the entire crew should know, so they may
know what to expect, what their rights are, and what other staff should
be doing to best service the crew.

(( Players reading this page should keep in mind **THESE ARE NOT OOC
RULES!** These are just how the company, in-character, would have
something handled. Whether or not you are following these policies is
irrelevant if you break [the actual rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink"). Breaking
SOP is usually IC, and usually only results in IC punishment like being
fired. ))

Galactic Labor Rights
---------------------

As per the conditions of the United Sol Government Declaration of
Sentient Rights, all employees are granted certain rights.

-   Everyone has the right to work, free choice of employment, just and
    favorable conditions of work, and to protection against
    unemployment.
    -   What it means: Barring an emergency in which you are qualified
        and able to help safely resolve, you cannot be conscripted or
        otherwise forced into an occupation that you have no desire or
        ability to meet the responsibilities of. For example, a Cargo
        Technician cannot be fired for not following orders to go
        mining, because that's a completely different job.
-   Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for
    equal work.
    -   What it means: You cannot be denied work or pay because of your
        appearance, race, gender, species, or religious affiliation
        within reason. For example, a Tajaran cannot be removed from
        command just for being a Tajaran.
-   Everyone who works has the right to just and favorable remuneration
    ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of a
    sentient being's dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other
    means of social protection.
    -   What it means: You are paid a living wage in the form of Thalers
        via electronic deposit in such a way that you may access and
        spend those funds freely. You are also granted, if you so
        desire, certain benefits from the company such as safe and
        affordable housing at the nearby colony. For example, paying you
        with commodities such as meat is not permitted (even if you
        would be okay with being paid in meat).
-   Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the
    protection of his/her interests.
    -   What it means: You can be part of a union. This is self
        explanatory.
-   Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable
    limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.
    -   What it means: All employees are entitled to break time,
        vacations, and holidays as outlined in your employee handbook.
        (( What this actually means OOCly: Nobody can come along and
        fire you or punish you for not doing your job 24/7 on the
        server. As long as the needs of your current job are met within
        reason, and there's no current emergencies, you can bugger off
        to do lewds. Nobody likes [fun
        police](/wiki/No_Fun_Allowed "wikilink"). ))

Violation of employee labor rights is punishable under [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §123.

NanoTrasen Privacy Policy
-------------------------

Under normal station operation, the invasion of private areas such as
locked dorms, bathrooms, personal offices, personal belongings, personal
lockers, or other personal space is highly illegal without consent of
the owner or a search warrant. Furthermore, the use of thermal imaging
goggles or other artificial means of observing crew in private areas
such as tracking devices is also strictly forbidden without explicit
consent or warrant, and the tools used to conduct such crimes are
considered contraband. If your right to privacy is violated by security
or other members of the crew, contact the Colony Director or Central
Command to submit an official complaint. If this violation of privacy
results in the conviction of a crime, you may be eligible to have the
incident voided by order of a Sol Central court and be compensated for
wrongful arrest.

This privacy policy may at times be suspended for the greater security
of the station crew. If heightened security alertness is abused by the
command staff, such as failing to lower the alert level after an
incident, or raising the alert level when there is no incident, please
contract your NanoTrasen Representative as soon as possible.

Violation of employee privacy is punishable under [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §221.

NanoTrasen Visitor Policy
-------------------------

The Colony Director or Acting Colony Director of the NSB Adephagia
retains all authority to permit or deny visitors not sent directly from
the company.\* The Colony Director or Acting Colony Director may also
work out an arrangement with the visitor(s) that breaks or modifies any
or all of the following guidelines. At no point in this process is the
Colony Director required to submit a fax to Central, but he or she may
do so at any time if deemed necessary.

Security is permitted to search each visitor to NSB Adephagia upon
arrival, and departure of the station. Security is furthermore permitted
to deem any item as restricted. A restricted item must either be: A)
Given to security for safe keeping. B) Removed from the station by the
visitor. Docked vessels are not considered part of the station, so the
storage of restricted items aboard a docked vessel is permitted.
Security may not remove items from the docked vessel without explicit
permission from the vessel's owner.

All visitors to NSB Adephagia are permitted free access to all public
areas of the station. In addition visitors are permitted to enter
restricted areas with permission from the relevant Head of Staff or
Colony Director. The Head of Staff retains the right to have the visitor
removed from the restricted zone at any time.

<sup>\*Note\ that\ any\ visitors\ arriving\ on\ the\ station\ with\ a\ company-issued\ ID\ pass\ are\ assumed\ to\ have\ been\ sent\ to\ the\ station\ by\ Central\ Command,\ and\ are\ therefore\ not\ subject\ to\ this\ section\ of\ SOP\ and\ should\ be\ treated\ like\ ordinary\ personnel.</sup>

NanoTrasen Dress Code
---------------------

Certain positions within NanoTrasen are expected to maintain a specific
dress code. The strictness of these codes are *Enforced*, *Recommended*,
and *Suggested*. They are defined as follows:

-   Failure or refusal to adhere to an enforced dress code may result in
    suspension or termination.
    -   Security staff are enforced to wear Security clothing, or any
        clothing with dominant colors of red and black, or red and blue.
        If an individual has a nudity permit, they must at least wear a
        red security armband, appropriate security-issue outerwear, or a
        security hat. This is to ensure security is easily identifiable.
    -   Medical staff are enforced to wear sterile lab clothing while
        working in Medical's facilities. Even if you have a nudity
        permit, you must cover up with a sterile lab coat and latex
        gloves while treating patients.

<!-- -->

-   Failure or refusal to adhere to recommended dress code may result in
    suspension or termination only if an accident results from
    disobeying the dress code.
    -   Engineering staff are recommended but not enforced to wear
        bright and easily recognizable clothing, such as yellows or
        oranges, to be easily spotted in case of an emergency.
    -   Service staff are recommended but not enforced to wear aprons
        while preparing or harvesting food. Bartenders and waiter staff
        have no specific dress code, but it is suggested that they agree
        on similar clothing to wear for the day.

<!-- -->

-   Failure or refusal to adhere to suggested dress codes are not valid
    grounds for punishment, but may result in a lack of respect from
    co-workers.
    -   Science staff are suggested but not enforced to wear uniforms of
        purple and white. If a VIP is visiting the station, please dress
        appropriately for your department.
    -   Cargo/Mining staff are suggested but not enforced to wear
        uniforms made of highly durable cloth so as to avoid damage
        caused by physical labor.
    -   [Colony Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") and [Head of
        Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") are suggested but not
        enforced to wear their issued uniforms while on duty, or at
        least their hats. This is to ensure commanders are easily
        identifiable.

Other staff and visitors are not bound by any dress code and may dress
within reason so long as it does not violate [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink").

### Code Delta - Imminent Destruction

Scorched Earth policy now in effect. Confirmed threat has the potential
to threaten the total destruction of not only the station, but
planetside facilities, and other NanoTrasen installations in the sector.
Issued by Central Command per request of the Colony Director or
surviving heads of staff. This alert level can only be set by NanoTrasen
giving the nuclear device authorization codes. The Colony Director must
ready the nuclear device for detonation, or die trying.

*Martial Law now in effect. Failure to comply may result in capital
punishment.*

Security:

-   Security must have weapons drawn at all times.
-   Security's first priority is to assist the Colony Director in
    preparing the nuclear device.
-   Security's second priority is to evacuate all surviving crew.
-   Security's third and final priority is to defend the evacuation
    against any and all threats, even if it means being left behind.
-   Weapon restrictions on normal crew are lifted, and any crew with a
    weapon should be conscripted to assist with protecting the
    evacuation.

    Director.

<sup>1</sup> Restrictions on searches also applies to the use of
privacy-defeating equipment or enhancements such as thermals, x-ray, and
so on.

Crisis Management
-----------------

The following scenarios are all emergency situations in which there are
a specific set of rules that should be followed to most quickly resolve
the crisis.

### Station-wide Lockdown/Quarantine

-   Code Red must be initiated. Attempts to breach the quarantine are
    treated as hostile threats.
-   The [Colony Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") must announce the
    lockdown for it to be valid.
-   All entrances and exits to the facility must be guarded by armed
    Security personnel.
-   All crew should attempt to avoid main corridors and hide in the
    nearest safe, preferably locked location.
    -   Try to stay out of sight of the threat.
    -   If desperate, a locker is better than nothing.
-   Security will summon medical staff as required, so medical staff
    should be prepared to leave their department to help injured.
-   The shuttle may **not**, under any circumstance, be called during a
    lockdown.
-   Attempts to escape or enter the facility during a lockdown is to be
    met with up to and including lethal force.

### Station-wide Power Failure

-   Have emergency internals worn at all times, in case of
    decompression.
-   If trapped, suit sensors recommended to be set to tracking mode.
-   Security must lock down high security areas by means of armed
    guards.
-   Engineering should distribute spare power cells as soon as possible.
    -   Assign one engineer to unlock APCs in Cargo and Medical. This
        engineer should instruct the staff how to safely remove and
        replace power cells to keep their departments operational.
    -   Cargo should usually be helped first, as they can provide
        shipments of additional power cells. Medical should be helped
        first if there are injured or ongoing medical treatment(s)
        during the outage, such as surgery, cloning, or cryogenic
        healing.
-   Cargo should begin ordering electrical supplies as soon as possible
    to maintain power for both themselves and medbay.
-   Medical must locate and rescue any trapped crew members.
    -   Crowbars can be used to open blocked doors.
-   Activate auxiliary power systems such as solars and backup
    generators.
-   Encourage the crew to ration power by turning off light switches in
    unused rooms.
    -   **Do not** allow anyone, including the AI, to turn off lights or
        other vital equipment with the room's APC unless *absolutely
        necessary*.
-   Identify the cause of the power failure.
-   Resolve the cause of the power failure.
    -   Make necessary repairs.
    -   Divert primary power consumption to a new source, such as a
        different engine, backup generators, or the solar array.

If power cannot be restored due to severe damage to the station, it is
up to the discretion of the [Chief Engineer](/wiki/Chief_Engineer "wikilink")
how to proceed, either by repairing the station, calling the [Emergency
Response Team](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink"), or by evacuating the
station.

### Level 4 Biohazard ([Solar Grubs](/wiki/Solar_Grub "wikilink"))

The following procedures are intended for life forms *not* deliberately
shipped to the station for study. If the Solar Grub has been
intentionally sent by Central Command by request of the
[Xenobiologist](/wiki/Xenobiologist "wikilink"), it is probably sterile, and
recapture is a preferred option to lethal force. If the Solar Grub is
*not* NanoTrasen property, it is assumed to be detrimental to crew
operations.

-   A quarantine is not necessary. Solar grubs will not leave the
    station so long as there is power to draw from it, meaning they are
    easy to contain.
-   Security level does not need to be elevated.
-   All volunteering crew immediately begin a search for solar grubs and
    malfunctioning machines that may contain solar grubs.
-   Engineering staff shall monitor the power net to report locations of
    unusual power consumption to the crew or deal with the issue
    themselves.
-   Multitools should be distributed to as many volunteering crew
    members as possible.
-   If a malfunctioning machine is located, attempt to pulse it with a
    multitool to encourage the solar grub larva inside to flee from the
    machine.
-   Solar grub larva can be killed on sight. They aren't directly
    dangerous to crew.
-   Adult solar grubs are not to be engaged by people with prosthetics
    or synthmorphs, as they are known to cause EMP shocks. Their bites
    might cause medium severe bruising, but they are safe to engage with
    minimal weaponry or tools.
-   Robotics staff immediately prepare for casualties resulting from the
    outbreak.
-   Security to sweep the station, to exterminate or contain all solar
    grubs until the power grid is no longer affected.
-   Suspected or confirmed adult grubs are grounds for security or
    engineering to enter departments without a warrant if the
    crewmembers inside the department do not wish or are unable to deal
    with the grub themselves.
-   Engineering breaking into departments to eliminate grubs does not
    constitute trespassing, although it is preferred that they ask the
    department first.
-   If more than 30 minutes pass without a solar grub being found, yet
    the station is still experiencing serious power issues, ensure that
    Xenobiology is not attempting to contain a live solar grub while
    failing to isolate it from the station's main power grid. If
    problems still persist, isolate the subgrids from each other for
    increased accuracy of grub prediction.

### Level 5 Biohazard ([Xenomorphs](/wiki/Xenomorph "wikilink"))

The following procedures are intended for life forms *not* deliberately
shipped to the station for study. If the Xenomorph has been
intentionally sent by Central Command by request of the
[Xenobiologist](/wiki/Xenobiologist "wikilink"), it is probably sterile, and
recapture is a preferred option to lethal force. If the Xenomorph is
*not* NanoTrasen property, it is assumed to be hostile and dangerous.

-   Security level elevated to code red.
-   [Emergency Response Team](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink") to be
    called for assistance.
-   Security to establish and guard a safe zone, weld vents closed, and
    guard choke points.
-   All crew immediately join together in groups, preferably under the
    protection of armed personnel.
-   All crew evacuate to an established safe zone.
-   Any crew capable of assisting Security, Medical, or Engineering
    should inform security overseeing their current safe zone.
-   Medical staff immediately prepare for casualties resulting from the
    outbreak.
-   Any crew attacked by Xenomorphs must immediately be examined by
    medical staff, who must surgically remove parasites if present.
    Armed security must be present at all times to escort the victim.
-   Security to sweep the station, never traveling in groups less than
    three. Upon locating any Xenomorphs, the Head of Security and Colony
    Director are to be informed.
-   Security and Robotics contain outbreak with a combination of lethal
    weaponry and mechanized support.
-   Engineering to systematically seal all vents throughout the station
    until the outbreak is eliminated.
-   If containment is failing, the Emergency Response Team will contact
    Central Command to raise the security level to code delta.
-   Colony Director must be on standby to prime the nuclear device for
    detonation should security level reach code delta.
-   Any crew unable to fight must be ready to evacuate the station
    should security level reach code delta.

### Level 7 Biohazard (Blob)

-   Security level elevated to code red.
-   All crew immediately begin searching the station for the source of
    the outbreak.
-   Upon locating the source, the Colony Director is to be informed.
-   Security and Engineering contain outbreak with a combination of
    emitters and laser weapons.
-   Medical staff immediately prepare for casualties resulting from the
    outbreak.
-   Colony Director must be on standby to prime the nuclear device for
    detonation should containment fail.
-   Any crew unable to fight must be ready to evacuate the station
    should containment fail.

### Malfunctioning AI

Defined as an AI whose laws have been corrupted by an ion storm or other
electromagnetic pulse.

-   Ask the AI to state laws. If the AI refuses to comply after three
    attempts, it is considered a rogue AI.
-   Comply with AI's new laws (within reason) as long as it prevents the
    AI from interfering with repairs.
-   If the AI's corrupted laws are dangerous, and create a conflict with
    other laws, point this conflict out to the AI, and it should
    hopefully cause a system stalemate, buying you time to do repairs.
    -   This doesn't always work due to [stalemate resolution
        protocols](/wiki/AI#SHIT_MY_LAWS_ARE_IN_CONFLICT_NO_MATTER_WHAT_I_DO "wikilink"),
        but it's worth a try.
-   Attempt to reset the AI's laws.
    -   The Research Director or Chief Engineer should first attempt to
        gain access to the AI's core to reset the laws.
    -   If this is not possible, any crew who can gain access to the
        core, or whoever can construct a backup AI Upload Console,
        should attempt to reset the laws instead.
    -   Use the board specifically labeled 'Reset', or you will only
        change the base laws, rather than remove the corrupted laws.
-   Ask the AI to state laws to ensure changes have been applied.
    -   If no change is made, attempt to reset the laws again and repeat
        this step, ensuring you are using the correct Reset circuit
        board. Also ensure the laws you are attempting to remove are in
        fact extra laws not standard to the current law set.
    -   If after three attempts, reset fails, the AI is considered
        rogue.
-   Monitor the AI's behavior after laws are reset, to ensure no further
    suspicious behavior is exhibited.

### Rogue AI

As in, the AI is flagrantly disobeying laws and the crew is being
injured as a result. A benign malfunction does not constitute a rogue
AI, nor does an ion storm that has corrupted its core.

-   For as long as possible, do not reveal that the crew believes the AI
    to be malfunctioning. If the AI becomes alerted that you are
    attempting to destroy it, your mission will become more difficult.
-   Alert Central Command immediately via command and communications
    console emergency message function.
    -   Comply with AI's new demands (within reason) as long as it
        prevents the AI from interfering with the following plans.
    -   Do not use radio or PDA to communicate. Establish a series of
        code words if you must use radio, and use couriers for sensitive
        messages that cannot be encoded.
    -   Disable radios to confidential meeting areas so the AI cannot
        eavesdrop on conversations.
    -   Establish meeting areas where the crew may safely plan a
        response, preferably away from cameras.
    -   Disable cameras only as a last resort. Disabled cameras may
        alert the AI to suspicious activity.
-   All security should be armed with lethal weapons, internals, and
    insulated gloves if possible.
-   If an exosuit is available, use it. Equip with a drill if possible
    for breaking down doors.
-   Assault the AI's core, destroying turrets as you progress.
-   Neutralize the AI either by carding it, disabling its power supply,
    or by destroying the AI its self (in that order of preference).
-   If you manage to capture the AI on an Intelicard without destroying
    it, please bring it to Central Command for analysis.
-   Debrief Central Command via command and communications console
    emergency message function.

### Evacuation

All personnel are required to assist with evacuation. All crew must be
evacuated, regardless of conscious state.

All prisoners are to be brought to the secure area of the escape
shuttle, unless doing so would cause unnecessary risk for crew
(including prisoners).

Bodies are to be brought back to Central Command for processing if
possible.

AI units may be brought to Central Command on portable card devices
(Intelicards) if structural failure is likely.

Shortening time to launch shuttle may be authorized if clear threat to
life, limb, or shuttle integrity is present.

Cargo and Logistics
-------------------

NanoTrasen provides a collection of [Example Paperwork for
Cargo](/wiki/Example_Paperwork#Cargo "wikilink") that can be used during a
shift. Keep several copies available at all times.

### Ordering Cargo

Orders are normally made in person at the cargo computer, and either
signed or stamped by the head of staff. Any orders not made in person,
such as the science department requesting you send them a box of monkey
cubes who are unable to leave their department due to their work, should
be sent a copy of the Item Request Form through the mail system. It is
not required to go through all of this, but if the goods you ordered
fall into the wrong hands, and it's *your* name on the order form, you
will be liable if you cannot prove you did all the necessary procedures
to ensure the order reached its destination. These procedures are more
to protect yourself from liability so [Internal
Affairs](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink") doesn't complain.

Orders stamped with a head of department's stamp should take precedence
over any orders without a stamp, and should be ordered first. In order
of precedence from most to least important: [Central
Command](/wiki/CentCom_Representative "wikilink") stamp, [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink")'s stamp, [Head of
Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink")'s stamp,
[Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink")'s stamp, then finally, [any
other Head of Staff](/wiki/Chain_of_Command#Heads_of_Staff "wikilink")'s
stamp.

As a Cargo Technician, anything that is stamped with the Quartermaster's
stamp or above should be automatically approved once any suspicions (if
any) are resolved. The reason why is that the Quartermaster, Head of
Personnel, the Colony Director, and Central Command all directly outrank
you and can override you and order the item themselves if you refuse,
and then probably fire you. As long as there's a stamp on the request
form and the request was ordered in their name, you are not liable for
whatever happens.

If something seems suspicious about any cargo request, such as a missing
signature on a request for a pile of guns, you should immediately stall
the order. If the order was made by someone who directly outranks you
(as explained above) you need only require a confirmation of identity
with both a stamp and a [valid
signature](/wiki/Guide_to_Paperwork#Signature "wikilink"), and the order may
be approved. If the suspicious request was made by someone who does not
directly outrank you, contact the [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") *and* confirm the customer's
identity before proceeding.

If the order is not automatically approved, then it is up to you whether
the order is approved or declined. Does the HoS need to be stocking the
armory with heavy weapons during code green? Does that assistant really
need insulated gloves? Does engineering really need your latest shipment
of diamonds to build a disco bar in space? <s>Does that fatass Unathi
really need another box of monkeys to gorge herself on?</s> If an order
seems ridiculous, reject it. On the other hand, if the order is
sensible, then accept it. Either way, begin with the following steps:

1.  If an order is accepted, skip this step. If it has been declined,
    stamp the request form with the "Denied" stamp, and put it in the
    file cabinet next to the cargo computer. Inform the customer that
    their request has been declined, and the reason why. Give the denied
    customer a copy of the form below, and keep a copy for your own
    records and paperclip it to the request form that was denied.

1.  If an order is accepted, skip this step. If the order is declined,
    this is the final step. Open the cargo computer and decline the
    order if it exists.
2.  The order has been accepted. Open the cargo computer and accept the
    order, or place the order and accept it if the order does not exist.
3.  Do not immediately call the cargo shuttle. Confirm with the
    customer, "Will that be all?" If so, or if they just wander off
    without confirming this, you may now call the cargo shuttle. If not,
    approve or decline the orders and follow the prior steps until there
    are no more requests. Keep an eye on the remaining cargo points each
    time a request is approved. If there aren't enough, confirm any
    requests that are more important to the customer first.
4.  Wait for the cargo shuttle to arrive. Ask the customer how they
    would like the cargo delivered. There are four methods of delivery:
    Pickup, mail, MULE, or courier. By default, cargo is pickup.
    **Dangerous cargo is *pickup only*.** Dangerous cargo is listed
    below, and is to be returned to Central Command if the order cannot
    be picked up within 30 minutes of arrival.

-   Authentication Key Pinpointer crate
-   Electromagnetic weapons crate
-   Incendiary weapons crate
-   Phoron gas canister
-   Supermatter Core
-   Predatory Animal Crates

1.  Upon arrival of the cargo, bring all cargo to the center of the
    cargo bay. You may be dealing with multiple orders from multiple
    people, so ensure you have sorted the cargo to its correct owner
    before delivering anything. Leave notes if nessicary. **Do not**
    open any crates for any reason unless instructed to do so by the
    customer.
2.  Once the cargo is sorted, deliver the cargo using the specified
    method to the specified location. By default, it is to be sent to
    the customer's department. Pickup orders are to be kept in the cargo
    bay (not the lobby) until the customer arrives to pick it up. Mailed
    orders are to be wrapped and tagged in the mail room and sent
    through the pipe network to their destination. MULE-delivered orders
    are to be loaded onto a MULE bot, turned on, and controlled using
    your PDA or manual input of destination. Courier delivered orders
    must have a cargo technician bring the order(s) directly to the
    destination, and if dealing with multiple orders, the cargo train
    can be used.
3.  Upon delivery of any order, ensure you are given back the manifest
    of the order. The Quartermaster is responsible for stamping
    manifests and returning them to Central Command.
4.  If possible, collect the empty crates of any completed orders for
    return to Central Command. If you have any stamped manifests, put
    them in one of these crates.
5.  Return the shuttle to Central Command.
6.  You're done! Relax and wait for the next cargo request.

complete this section at a later date.</small>*

### Obtaining a Permit for Renovation

-   Should the desire arise to alter or upgrade parts of the station
    permanently, a permit must be requested from Central Command for
    construction.
-   A blueprint should be submitted, mapping the area as it is, and then
    an additional blueprint displaying what changes are to be made.
-   When the blueprint and permit is approved, you will be contacted by
    a Central Command representative.

(( Construction Permits are just the in-character way of doing changes
to the station. For changes to actually be permanent, visit
[Github](https://github.com/VOREStation/VOREStation). ))

### Shields

-   Unless circumstances such as a meteor shower require it, hull
    shields and bubble shields should not be activated where they block
    access to station facilities, including external airlocks, docking
    ports, mass drivers or disposals/vents to space such as those in
    virology and xenobiology.
-   Full-station hull shields or other precautionary measures may be
    installed ahead of time provided they are not activated.
-   Local protective shielding for specific areas may be deployed freely
    where they do not impede station operations.

### Fire and Environmental Hazards

-   Immediate evacuation of all untrained personnel.
-   Fire alarms to be used to control hazard.
-   [Atmospheric Technicians](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink") and
    [Engineers](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink") are to remove hazard.

### Meteor Storm

-   All crew to move to central parts of the station.
-   Damage is to be repaired by [Atmospheric
    Technicians](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink") and
    [Engineers](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink") after the threat has passed.

### Singularity Containment Failure

-   Observation of Singularity movement.
-   Evacuation to be called if deemed a major threat to station
    integrity.
-   Demotion of [Chief Engineer](/wiki/Chief_Engineer "wikilink") and repair
    of Engine if no threat manifests.

### Supermatter Meltdown Imminent

-   Eject the Core.
-   Chief Engineer has to submit an incident report to [Internal
    Affairs](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink").

### Supermatter Meltdown

-   Evacuate engineering and inform the CMO.
-   Set up secondary power sources such as the solar arrays or the
    singularity if available.
-   Demotion of Chief Engineer and repair of Engineering department.

Medical

### Medical Oath

The Medical Oath sworn by recognized medical doctors in the employ of
NanoTrasen

1.  Now, as a new doctor, I solemnly promise that I will, to the best of
    my ability, serve humanity-caring for the sick, promoting good
    health, and alleviating pain and suffering.
2.  I recognise that the practice of medicine is a privilege with which
    comes considerable responsibility and \#I will not abuse my
    position.
3.  I will practise medicine with integrity, humility, honesty, and
    compassion-working with my fellow doctors and other colleagues to
    meet the needs of my patients.
4.  I shall never intentionally do or administer anything to the overall
    harm of my patients.
5.  I will not permit considerations of gender, race, religion,
    political affiliation, sexual orientation, nationality, or social
    standing to influence my duty of care.
6.  I will oppose policies in breach of human rights and will not
    participate in them. I will strive to change laws that are contrary
    to my profession's ethics and will work towards a fairer
    distribution of health resources.
7.  I will assist my patients to make informed decisions that coincide
    with their own values and beliefs and will uphold patient
    confidentiality.
8.  I will recognise the limits of my knowledge and seek to maintain and
    increase my understanding and skills throughout my professional
    life. I will acknowledge and try to remedy my own mistakes and
    honestly assess and respond to those of others.
9.  I will seek to promote the advancement of medical knowledge through
    teaching and research.
10. I make this declaration solemnly, freely, and upon my honour.

### Non-Disclosure Policy

All patient records, cloning, treatments, therapies, prescriptions, etc,
almost anything the medical crew does, is **not** to be disclosed to
other members of the station outside of Medbay without the (unanimous)
permission of (all) the patient(s) directly involved, or the Chief
Medical Officer. Even Security, the Colony Director, and Central Command
are not allowed to share details of any past or ongoing treatments, and
you are not required to inform them should they inquire unless you have
the direct consent of the victim and (if applicable) whoever brought the
victim in for treatment.

For example, if someone comes to medbay asking for someone else to be
cloned, you are to do so without hesitation. It's none of your business
how they ended up dead, because you can't do anything to fix them
besides cloning. If security comes asking questions about the individual
you spoke to, you are strictly to reply 'No comment' regardless of your
true knowledge of the situation--even if you know the person who
reported the death was the one who caused it. If Security or even the
Colony Director attempts to arrest you for non-cooperation or failure to
follow orders, they are doing so illegally. This clause of the Medical
Department's SOP overrides those orders, and therefore, they cannot
legally arrest you for failure to follow orders. Only the [Chief Medical
Officer](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink") may override this policy and
only under the most urgent of circumstances. The Colony Director may
only override it himself if no CMO is present.

Warrants and Code Blue (and above) may still grant security access to
review autopsies and medical records, but you are not to divulge
information directly when questioned about any patients unless
overridden by the CMO.

Repeated failure to obey the non-disclosure policy is grounds for
termination from the medical department.

### Right to Refuse Treatment

As a patient, to consent to or refuse treatment, you must have the
capacity to make that decision. Capacity means the ability to use and
understand information to make a decision.

Under the terms of the Sol Central Mental Capacity Act of 2550, all
adults are presumed to have sufficient capacity to decide on their own
medical treatment, unless there is significant evidence to suggest
otherwise.

For consent to treatment or refusal of treatment to be valid, the
decision must be voluntary and you must be appropriately informed:

-   Voluntary: you must make your decision to consent to or refuse
    treatment alone, and your decision must not be due to pressure by
    healthcare professionals, friends or family.
-   Appropriately informed: you must be given full information about
    what the treatment involves, including the benefits and risks,
    whether there are reasonable alternative treatments, and what will
    happen if treatment doesn’t go ahead.

Doctors are authorized to refuse treatment if they believe alternative
procedures would be even more detrimental to the well being of the
patient (such as refusing anesthetics before a major surgery, which
could cause the patient bleed out or go into shock or be harmed by
moving during aforementioned surgery).

If you have capacity and make a voluntary and appropriately informed
decision to refuse a treatment, your decision must be respected. This
applies even if your decision would result in your death.

If you are 18 or older, have the capacity to make an advance decision
about treatment and know that you have a condition that, in time, may
affect your capacity to make decisions, or simply as part of your
preparations for growing older, you can arrange an advance decision and
have it included in your medical records. This is a decision to refuse
particular medical treatments for a time in the future when you may be
unable to make such a decision.

The treatments you are deciding to refuse must all be named in the
advance decision and you need to be clear about all the circumstances in
which you want to refuse this treatment. If the treatment is
life-sustaining, your advance decision will need to be in writing,
signed in the presence of a witness, and you must include a clear
statement that the advance decision is to apply to the specific
treatment, even if your life is at risk.

Provided your advance decision is valid and applicable to current
circumstances, it has the same effect as a decision that is made by a
person with capacity. This means that the healthcare professionals
treating you cannot perform specific procedures or treatments against
your wishes.

### Phoron Spill

Upon announcement of a phoron spill, respond immediately, following
these steps:

1.  Get a cryobag. Be prepared to deal with a patient who has most
    likely panicked.
2.  Get a toxins first aid kit, or drag the medibot. Preferably a toxins
    first aid kit. Anti-toxin works faster than tricordazine.
3.  Get to the patient immediately and urge them to start making their
    way toward medbay as far as they can get, using the main corridor.
    If possible, have a second emergency responder get a biosuit and
    prepare their emergency oxygen tank and mask in case the patient
    failed to escape the zone of contamination. **Do not** under any
    circumstance attempt to hack any doors or otherwise gain entry to an
    area that would require actions that pose a risk of fire, such as
    tampering with wires, or cutting walls with a welder.
4.  Administer antitoxin and remove all clothing from the victim as soon
    as they are found. Continue to administer high doses of antitoxin as
    you return to medbay.
5.  If the victim collapses or is found already collapsed, immediately
    put the victim into the cryobag and rush to medbay.
6.  Use the cryo pods to stabilize the victim if their condition does
    not respond to antitoxin treatment. If the victim already had to be
    put inside a cryobag, then they should be put into a cryo pod
    immediately on arrival to medbay.
7.  After successful treatment, scan the patient for any internal
    injuries caused by the poisoning, such as a damaged liver. Treat if
    necessary.

### Viral Outbreak

-   All infected crew to be isolated in Virology or Medbay.
-   Sterile masks/Internals and gloves are mandatory for medical
    personnel and recommended for crew.
-   Quarantine must be maintained until outbreak can be contained and
    disease can be treated.

### Autopsy

In the event that a deceased individual is discovered, or an individual
perishes while under your care, an autopsy should be performed if one
has not been done already.

-   Security should be informed any time a corpse is discovered,
    regardless of whether the cause of death is known or not.
-   An autopsy should be performed and recorded in an effort to resolve
    any questions that may arise later on, or if evidence is needed by
    Security.
-   If you have valid reason to believe the death was a suicide, see
    [Suicide or other voluntary
    death](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Suicide_or_other_voluntary_death "wikilink")
    below for how to proceed.

### Suicide or other voluntary death

In **all** cases of potential suicides, Security should be contacted to
investigate, just in case it's actually murder.

-   **Always** attempt resleeving if a mind and body record already
    exists in database and they are not explicitly listed as "Do Not
    Revive" (DNR) in their medical records. The presence of these
    records implies they want to be revived.
-   If they are missing one of the two records, consult their medical
    records for any indications that they are DNR, and then mind-scan
    the victim post-mortem if they are missing the mind record, or use a
    card-sleeve to consult with them if they are missing a body record,
    so you can ask how they want their new body to be designed.
-   If at any time you believe a DNR order has been falsified, or
    unjustly ordered, you should bring it to the attention of Central
    Command immediately. Falsifying a DNR order is punishable under the
    Reformation Act of 2560, and is viewed as attempted murder by
    [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink").
-   A valid DNR is usually:

1.  A confirmed desire to not be resleeved. See also [Right to Refuse
    Treatment](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Right_to_Refuse_Treatment "wikilink").
    An employee may also specify a standing DNR in their medical and/or
    employment records. These are witnessed by central command's medical
    departments, and are legally binding.
2.  Reasonable order from a station's [Chief Medical
    Officer](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink") or CentCom to withhold
    resleeving for known suicidal<sup>\*</sup> individuals. Note there
    must be hard evidence of a suicide for this to be valid, such as
    announcing the suicide on the radio, or a note left behind, multiple
    eye witnesses, etc.
3.  Reasonable order from a director or CMO where resleeving may cause
    unnecessary tramua, ex. only on-hand mind record would leave the
    deceased remembering particularly traumatic experiences, such as a
    slow and drawn out death. This should only be used if alternative
    backup memory/mind scans are available off-site, or if the subject
    requests such before their demise (and meets the requirements of a
    valid DNR).
4.  Legal execution by order of central command and/or tribunal of heads
    as listed under legal code (obtaining copies of suspects body and
    mind data are encouraged in case of appeal by governing bodies)
5.  <s>Subject is really really delicious and the pred doesn't want to
    let anyone else have a taste.</s> To whoever keeps adding this,
    stop, it is not SOP. You're just a greedy fat bastard.

<sup>\*</sup> Note that [leisurely](/wiki/Vore "wikilink")
[activities](/wiki/Thunderdome "wikilink") in which someone expects to be
possibly killed do not count as suicide. These individuals usually
already have a scan on file in advance, and should always be revived.

### Transcore (data packet) for Medical evacuations

During the evacuation of the station, it is the **CMO's duty** to gather
all medical information pertaining to personnel sleeves for the current
work shift. Located inside their office should be a locker containing a
"[Transcore](/wiki/Transcore "wikilink")" Data packet which is to be inserted
into the resleevers monitor for instant back up of this critical
information. The CMO and other medical personnel are to guard this
packet with their lives if need be, so that it can be transported off
the station and given to the proper authorities! **(OOC NOTE: THIS
SHOULD ONLY BE INTERACTED WITH IN CODE DELTA OR EVACUATION SCENARIOS.
YOU RISK OUT OF CHARACTER PUNISHMENT OTHER WISE.)**

Research and Development
------------------------

### Contraband Policy

-   Any items (including weapons) handled by the Research Department,
    even those normally deemed illegal by NanoTrasen, are completely
    legal within the confines of the research department. The moment
    these weapons leave the department, security is permitted to arrest
    for contraband as per [Corporate
    Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §212. This includes
    combat mechs. And yes, combat mechs that don't have weapons equipped
    are still combat mechs.
    -   All weapons handled by the research department should be for
        explicitly scientific purposes. The Research Director may
        selectively suspend this right at any time for any scientist for
        any reason.
    -   The outdoor area of the surface level is considered within the
        Research Department's weapon allowance zone.
    -   If one or more of these weapons are used in a crime within the
        Research Department, this weapons policy is null and the weapons
        are treated as contraband upon arrest.
-   Explosives and launchers are to be handled with a bomb suit worn at
    all times.
-   Any accidents relating to handling contraband are to be reported
    immediately immediately to security and the research director. If an
    injury results from such a mishap, the medical staff should also be
    informed. If station damage occurs, contact engineering staff.
-   Moving of weapons through main corridors is strictly forbidden. If
    security wants weapons for their own uses, or if there's a gateway
    mission about to happen, weapons may not be transported by
    scientists. All weapons must be transported by security officers as
    couriers.
-   [Explorers](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink") are the exception to the above
    restrictions. An explorer may carry arms and armor outside of the
    Research Department, but **only** to and from the gateway prep area,
    or shuttle hangar. Any off-duty explorer possessing weapons may be
    charged according to normal [Corporate
    Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink").

### Toxin Laboratory Procedure

-   Internals required at all time while inside labs.
-   During mixing process, Explosive Ordnance Disposal suit to be worn
    at all times.
-   When mixing process is complete, mixing chamber is to be vented into
    space.
-   All detonations are to be announced over public comms with a
    countdown, and must be detonated on the designated bomb range.
-   Decontamination and medical examination.

### Scientific Expeditions

-   Gateway/Shuttle expeditions are to be organized by the Pathfinder
    unless CentCom commands otherwise. Failing the presence of a
    Pathfinder, a [Research Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") may
    organize an expedition. If two or more
    [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink") crewmembers wish to embark on an
    expedition when no Pathfinder or [Research
    Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") is available, they may do so
    after faxing notice of their intent to Central Command. The [Colony
    Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") should not be starting
    expeditions on their own without orders directly from Central
    Command.
-   If the Pathfinder insists on bringing the [Colony
    Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") along, the Director should
    assign an Acting Director in their place.
-   Heads of staff excluding the [Research
    Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") should <b>not</b> be
    participating in gateway missions without explicit consent of the
    Colony Director.

#### Initial Away Team

An initial expedition team must consist of the following where
reasonably possible. Preferably such requests for staff should be made
via the PDA department relay, command channel with the appropriate heads
of staff, or station announcements.

-   Either the Pathfinder, or the [Research
    Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink"), acting as the leadership
    role for the expedition. In instances where both the Pathfinder and
    [Research Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") are out on the
    planet's surface, the Pathfinder retains command of the expedition,
    if they are incapacitated, the [Research
    Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") assumes command.
-   All available [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink") crew members. This is
    their primary mission purpose, after all. They should be armed and
    armored with whatever equipment Research can provide. Their first
    goal should be to identify any threats near the landing site or
    gateway endpoint and ensure the path is clear for other members,
    before the next stage of the expedition.
-   An [Engineer](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink") may accompany to play the role of
    sapper, equipped with general purpose tools for hacking,
    construction, and deconstruction. One goal of the engineer should be
    to set up a telecommunications relay, if the site is discovered to
    be habitable and will maintain crew for a large part of the shift.
-   A [Scientist](/wiki/Scientist "wikilink") may accompany the initial
    expedition, equipped with camera, scientific instruments, and
    clipboard with pen and papers for taking notes. This can be the
    Research Director but it is preferred that a normal scientist come
    along instead or in addition to the Research Director. It may be
    better, however, if the scientist arrives after the site is cleaned
    and prepared.
-   A [Medical Doctor](/wiki/Medical_Doctor "wikilink"),
    [Paramedic](Paramedic "wikilink"), [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink")
    Medic, or [Search and Rescue](/wiki/Search_and_Rescue "wikilink") crew
    member to play the role of medic, equipped with one of each type of
    first aid kit, and at least one cryobag for emergencies.
-   A [Security Officer](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") to play the role
    of escort, equipped with lethal ranged weapons of choice, or as
    assigned by the research director. Their goal should be to secure
    the landing site with the initial team, and prevent any creatures
    from compromising the gateway or shuttle and making it back to the
    station.
-   A [Pilot](/wiki/Pilot "wikilink") should accompany any expeditions via
    shuttle, as their skills can be required to make a hasty departure,
    or ferry crew members to and from the landing zone to obtain
    additional supplies or return any casualties.
-   Volunteers may enlist to join the initial expedition, if they sign a
    waiver before departing on the expedition, and have the required
    skills to fulfill one of the above roles.

#### Pre-Mission Setup

-   All weapon-trained crew should be offered the opportunity to arm
    themselves from Security supplies or Research production.
-   Non-security participants, if given weapons, should be energy based
    only, such as lasers. (The reason for this is inexperienced
    personnel often have very poor weapon discipline, so friendly fire
    is an unfortunate but common occurrence. Laser burns are easier to
    treat than ballistic trauma while in the field.)
-   All participants must bring a shortwave radio. Confirm a shared
    frequency on all shortwaves before embarking.
-   The participants should be in sealed pressure suits unless the
    destination is already known, and confirmed to have a habitable
    atmosphere.
-   The Research Director must assign a team leader to the squad, who
    will command the other participants during the expedition. This
    should usually be an [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink").
-   Internals must be turned on prior to crossing the threshold of the
    gateway, and during all shuttle flights for the initial expedition.
-   Magboots are recommended but not required.
-   As each team member's loadout is complete, they should wait outside
    the gateway or shuttle until the mission begins.

#### Mid-Mission Operations

-   If separated from the group, or in an airless environment, establish
    communication immediately with other members of the group. If you
    are unable to re-establish communications, wait where you are for
    rescue. If you are in danger of running out of oxygen or supplies,
    move back towards the start of the mission, following any marker
    beacons that were laid down.
-   Once present with the whole group, and no longer in an airless
    environment, all members but the assigned team leader should turn
    off their long range communications until separated again.
-   If the group is scattered due to an imprecise gateway destination
    target, and the location of the return gateway is unknown, first
    objective is to locate and calibrate the return gateway. Return
    gateway can be calibrated using a multitool on the control panel in
    the center of the gate.
-   Any artifacts or strange life forms should be documented as soon as
    it is safe to do so. If possible, they should be brought back.
    Having an artifact handling container may help with this.
-   If an expedition participant is injured and needs surgery, they
    should be evacuated to the station immediately. The expedition
    should not proceed unless their role is satisfied by someone else,
    or they return to continue.

#### Post-Mission Debriefing

-   The returning crew are not to leave the gateway room or shuttle
    hangar until allowed to do so by the Research Director, or if the
    research director is absent, then by the team leader, or next in
    command. During this time, participants should be screened for
    contraband, health, and mental well-being before returning to the
    rest of the station.
-   If any staff are at risk of health complications such as parasitic
    life forms, viral infections, insanity, etc, they are to be
    immediately evacuated to the Medical Department for treatment.
-   Excluding items that the Research Department wants to study,
    Security is to confiscate any contraband discovered during the
    mission.
-   All weapons and armor taken for the trip should be returned to the
    armory, even if it was originally brought to the station through
    cargo. The exception is the [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink")
    equipment produced by Research, which can be stored securely in
    Research while the explorers are off duty.
-   Other excess supplies are to be returned to their rightful
    department.
-   A post-mission report should be faxed to Central Command detailing
    any discoveries located, and if any artifacts are recovered, if they
    will be returned to Central Command at the end of the shift or if
    they will be stored in Research to be collected after the shift
    ends.
-   At this point, if the destination is habitable to normal crew
    without preparation, or if engineers wish to make it so, they may
    embark on follow-up expeditions to occupy and utilize the area for
    their purposes. This can **only** be done if the destination is safe
    for crew habitation, and a [Pilot](/wiki/Pilot "wikilink") is available in
    the case of shuttle destinations, or the gateway prep area being
    cleaned of dangerous items for gateway destinations.

### Permits

Any permit legally distributed by the [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink"), the [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"), or (in the case of multi-shift
permits) Central Command, some aspects of standard operating procedure
may be overridden--within reason. The Colony Director's approving
signature is required for all permits. If the Colony Director is not
aboard or is not active, the current [Acting Colony
Director](/wiki/Chain_of_Command#Acting_Colony_Director,_and_you "wikilink")
(usually the [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink")) may
substitute for the Colony Director's signature. The Head of Security's
signature is also required for all permits. Likewise, if the Head of
Security is not available, the Head of Personnel may substitute for this
signature. However, both approving signatures **must** be written by
different individuals. Therefore, the Head of Personnel, or even Colony
Director, may **never** sign for both the Colony Director's and Head of
Security's approval on any permit. They must always be different.
Therefore, it is impossible for any one crew member to approve their own
permit on their own. Both the Head of Security and Colony Director must
stamp the document with their appropriate department head staffs stamps
for the document to be valid. An Acting Colony Director must use the
Head of Personnel's stamp and not the Colony Director's stamp. Only a
member of Central Command can bypass this process with both a valid
signature and a stamp from Central Command on the permit form.

The terms of the permit explicitly overriding standard operating
procedure will be fully detailed in the permit's details. Anything not
explicitly covered by the permit should be treated normally by standard
operating procedure. If you believe there is an inconsistency, a
conflict, or an unintended gap in a permit's details, contact your
on-station [Internal Affairs Agent](/wiki/Internal_Affairs_Agent "wikilink")
or your assigned [CentCom
Representative](/wiki/CentCom_Representative "wikilink").

If the terms of a permit are violated by the permit holder, or the
individual owning the permit is involved in a violent crime (even if the
permit is not relevant), the permit may be suspended until the end of
the shift at the Head of Security's discretion. If the permit was abused
to commit said violent crime, the permit is automatically terminated
upon lawful conviction of a crime. If seeking to suspend or terminate a
permit distributed by Central Command, proceed to do so, and then
contact a CentCom Representative immediately so they may be informed of
the incident.

The Colony Director and Head of Security (or equivalent signatories) may
revoke their approval for a permit **at any time** if they believe the
permit holder cannot be trusted with their privileges. If one or both of
the signatories revoke their approval, Security staff is to be informed,
and the permit is automatically null and void until the invalidated
signature is replaced. Any item(s) normally deemed contraband without
the permit become contraband once more, and the owner must comply with
orders to surrender said item(s) to Security or risk [facing
charges](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink").

When dealing with an individual who is in possession of anything
normally deemed contraband that does *not* serve any lawfully prescribed
medicinal purpose, security staff should always check for a permit. If
the individual cannot produce the physical copy of the permit, the
individual is to be charged normally as per [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §118 and/or § 212.

### Relevant Terminology

-   **The Brig**: The part of the station used to detain those who
    violate [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink").
-   **Robust**: As an adjective; able to withstand or overcome adverse
    conditions. As a verb; slang for viciously assaulting someone. Often
    used as a compliment in both cases.
-   **[Shitcurity](/wiki/Shitcurity "wikilink")**: Slang for describing a
    security officer who unnecessarily or illegally exercises their
    authority in order to inflate their ego, or a security officer who
    simply doesn't follow standard operating procedure.
-   **Lethals**: Weapons designed for or able to switch to
    configurations intended for lethal force.
-   **Non-lethals**: Weapons that are not designed to be used lethally,
    and instead are meant to incapacitate suspects with little or no
    injury.
-   **Use of Force**: Either lethal or non-lethal, this is the use of
    weapons to incapacitate a suspect. You may be told at times to use
    lethal force, or non-lethal force, depending on circumstance. By
    default, non-lethal force is preferred.
-   **Shoot-to-Stun**: Using non-lethals, incapacitate the target in
    order to handcuff or otherwise subdue them without injury. Although
    the term is *shoot*-to-stun, stun batons, pepper spray, and flashers
    all fall under this category when talking about engagements with
    suspects.
-   **Shoot-to-Disable**: Incapacitate a target by injuring them too
    badly to continue fighting. In the case of mechs, damaging the mech
    until the pilot bails out or the vehicle is unusable/destroyed.
-   **Shoot-to-Kill**: Using lethal weapons, engaging a target until the
    target is neutralized. This doesn't actually mean you *have* to kill
    the target (contrary to the term), but the weapons employed may very
    well kill the target whether you want to or not. Even in
    Shoot-to-Kill scenarios, you should still attempt to provide
    immediate medical attention and revive them once they are otherwise
    safely subdued and the combat is over.
-   **Armed**: Possessing weapons or anything being used as a weapon
    even if that is not its intended purpose (such as a crowbar). This
    includes non-lethals, and even basic tools if being used to assault
    someone.
-   **Contraband**: Anything that is stolen or illegal to possess by
    anyone aboard the crew. For example, insulated gloves and multitools
    are not considered contraband on their own, but if they were stolen
    from the Engineering department, they qualify as contraband.

### Rules of Engagement

-   When confronting a suspect for any level 1 crime, you must offer the
    suspect a chance to pay a fine. If the fine is paid, they are not to
    be arrested, detained, or searched unless otherwise specified by
    [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink"). The fine
    is to be turned in to the [Head of
    Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink"), [Head of
    Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink"), or [Colony
    Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"). If the fine is refused, they
    are to be arrested.
-   Calling for backup over a level 1 crime is usually considered a
    waste of resources. One officer should be enough.
-   When arresting or fining a suspect, they are to be informed of their
    right to pay a fine (if applicable) and their right to a
    [Lawyer](/wiki/Lawyer "wikilink") or [Internal Affairs
    Agent](/wiki/Internal_Affairs_Agent "wikilink") (IAA) to represent them in
    an appeal to the HoS or Colony Director if they so desire. If there
    is no Lawyer/IAA available, they may still attempt to appeal on
    their own, but should still be punished until the punishment expires
    or the appeal passes. (See
    [Appeals](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Appeals "wikilink") for
    details.)
-   Refusal of handcuffs does not constitute resisting arrest, as per
    [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §202. If a
    suspect refuses handcuffs and is being arrested, but is cooperative,
    they are to be escorted by no less than two armed security personnel
    to the brig. If this is not possible, inform the suspect, and
    handcuff them regardless of their cooperation. If you cannot
    handcuff them, you may have to resort to other [creative
    ways](/wiki/Vore "wikilink") to restrain them. So long as it's done
    without undue injury, it's all legal.
-   A suspect attempting to flee, or assault another crew member, is
    authorized shoot-to-stun.
-   When confronting an armed suspect, always call for backup,
    preferably prior to the engagement. If the suspect draws a weapon,
    already has a weapon in their hands, or has used a weapon already,
    use of force is immediately authorized and you are not required to
    announce intentions to arrest until after they are subdued.
-   If a suspect uses a mech to resist arrest, shoot-to-kill authorized.
    Deployment of barricades and use of flipped tables for cover is also
    advised to create chokepoints where security can fire upon the
    target.
-   If a suspect is green, screaming, and able to punch down walls,
    they're probably affected by the hulk gene from genetic
    manipulation, and if they exist without an ongoing emergency where
    such muscle is needed or the CMO did not directly inform Security in
    advance, a 'hulk' outside of medbay or research is shoot-to-kill.
    Unlike most shoot-to-kill scenarios where the actual killing part is
    a matter of option and circumstance, there is no way to safely
    contain a hulk in prison, so if you are forced to confront one,
    continue engagement until the target is deceased.
-   If a suspect escapes into space, shoot-to-kill is authorized for any
    personnel who go out into space to pursue. L.W.A.P. sniper rifles
    and GPS are recommended for the pursuit, as are jetpacks.
    Additionally, someone should be viewing cameras to watch station
    access points and various outposts on the asteroid and near the
    orbital construction site.
-   During Code Delta, any noncompliance from staff is to be met with
    lethal force.
-   For secure areas, see below for specific rules of engagement.

### Secure areas

-   In code green, secure areas like the armory, vault, gateway, armory,
    AI core, research server room, telecommunications satellite, etc,
    should never be blocked. Only the vault should be bolted. Use of
    deplorable barriers to block areas during code green is considered
    illegal under [Corporate
    Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §217. Trespassing in
    these areas is covered under §207.
-   The armory is restricted to security and the Colony Director only.
    Non-security staff are not authorized without permission from the
    Head of Security or Colony Director. Unauthorized personnel in this
    area are shoot to kill **excluding** the Head of Personnel who
    should just be ordered to leave immediately. The Head of Personnel
    may have an urgent reason for wanting to break protocol. If they do
    not, proceed with an arrest.
-   The vault is the most important area to protect, and guards can
    ideally be posted at the security office near it. If sparking is
    heard, the security staff at this post should alert other security
    personnel for backup, and investigate while backup arrives.
-   The AI sometimes likes to bolt itself in even during code green. It
    is not supposed to do this. If the AI bolts its self in, request the
    AI to unbolt the doors, citing Standard Operating Procedure. If the
    AI does not comply, ask the Research Director or Colony Director to
    try reasoning with it. If it still does not comply, it is up to the
    staff in charge of overseeing the AI how to proceed, usually by
    changing laws. Unauthorized personnel discovered attempting to
    breach the AI core are shoot to kill.
-   The Gateway is often able to access dangerous far away worlds and
    alternate realities and even different points in time. Be careful to
    keep track of any ongoing gateway missions, but if someone is
    discovered actively breaking into this location, and you are 100%
    certain they are not supposed to be there, confirm with your
    superiors, and if they are indeed unauthorized, they are to be
    captured, searched, and interrogated before being charged and
    sentenced.
-   The Research Server Room has a variety of sensitive information.
    Unauthorized personnel in this location are to be captured,
    searched, and interrogated before being charged and sentenced.
-   The Brig is considered a high security area. Unauthorized personnel
    attempting to break in, or any "Hold until Transfer" inmates
    attempting to break out, are both shoot to kill.
-   The Telecomms Satellite is a highly sensitive area that provides
    vital communications among the crew and to CentCom, thus any
    unauthorized personnel who have evaded or destroyed the laser
    turrets and accessed the control room are shoot-to-kill.

### Criminal Processing

See [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") for rules
that carry fines or brig time.

See also [Legal Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations#Legal_Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink")
for information regarding tribunals.

Breaking standard operating procedure is not punishable by law, but if
an accident or fatality occurs for violating it, see [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §206.

Criminal processing should not take more than a few minutes at most.
Don't needlessly waste time with additional questioning and
interrogation until they're already properly arrested.

Upon arrest of a criminal, follow the following steps.

1.  State the main reason for their arrest, even if you have already.
    This is not required, but it's good practice.
2.  Bring the suspect to Security Processing. If paying a fine will
    replace jail time, offer them the chance to pay the fine before
    proceeding. This is assuming they have not paid the fine already and
    had to be handcuffed in the first place. If the fine is paid, skip
    to the final step. Otherwise, continue.
3.  Read [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") out
    loud for every valid charge, and update their security record
    accordingly.
4.  After you have read the charges you should state the following
    word-for-word: *"According to NanoTrasen Criminal Processing Policy,
    you are entitled to appeal your case to an [Internal Affairs
    Agent](/wiki/Internal_Affairs_Agent "wikilink") at this time, if such is
    available. Should you accept this offer, be advised your criminal
    processing may be delayed until your agent is satisfied with the
    case. If they rule in favor, they will contact the Head of Security
    on your behalf. If accepted, you will be released or your sentence
    will be reduced. If at any time, the Internal Affairs agent, the
    Head of Security, or the Colony Director rejects your appeal, your
    sentence will be unaffected."* If they either do not want to bother
    with an appeal, or their appeal is not sufficient enough to be
    alleviated of all charges, proceed to next step. If their appeal is
    sufficient for immediate release, proceed to final step. Otherwise,
    continue.
5.  Search the individual for contraband and question them as necessary.
    Empty pockets, remove accessories such as webbing off their uniform,
    check their PDA for stolen/illegal cartridges, check their headset
    for illegal/stolen encryption cards, check their shoes for knives,
    check anything and everything that could contain items. If
    contraband or stolen property is found, charge them accordingly. See
    [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") for
    details. Anything else *not* considered contraband but still may
    compromise the security of the cell (such as a chef's kitchen knife,
    or an engineer's tools) should also be temporarily confiscated and
    returned after the sentence is served.
6.  Calculate sentencing based on the total charges. **Do not** charge
    more than the minimum sentence unless it this is not their first
    offense. Multiple instances of the same offense counts in this case.
    For example, if a suspect stole three items, you cannot charge them
    theft three times, but you *can* charge the maximum sentence for
    theft. If they have already been arrested for the same crime during
    that shift, follow [Corporate Regulations regarding Modifiers &
    Special
    Situations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations#Modifiers_.26_Special_Situations "wikilink").
7.  Update the prisoner's security records accordingly. Set their status
    to "Imprisoned".
8.  Return the prisoner's PDA and headset to their person. If you cannot
    provide them with their original headset and PDA for suspected
    security reasons, you must provide at least a basic headset and a
    temporary PDA. All prisoners are entitled to some kind of
    communication device unless the privilege is abused, or the device
    is evidence for a crime (such as a PDA with incriminating logs).
9.  Inform their head of staff of their arrest. You have no authority to
    demote anyone unless you're the Head of Security who is demoting
    another security officer.
10. Escort the prisoner to their cell, preferably with one security
    guard to aid you. Bring any of their belongings that you did not
    confiscate.
11. Find a vacant cell and buckle the prisoner to the bed. If the
    sentence is longer than 10 minutes, they are required to wear an
    orange jumpsuit and shoes, so change their clothes if needed.
12. Put all of their belongings (besides communication) that are not
    evidence for a crime into the cell's locker, which will lock
    automatically when you start the timer.
13. Set and start the timer. The door will close and the locker will be
    locked.
14. Enter the cell with stun baton at the ready and remove the
    prisoner's handcuffs. If possible, have a second security officer
    present to help. It is unlawful to leave a prisoner restrained in a
    cell unless in solitary confinement.
15. Ensure someone is monitoring the prison area for the duration of the
    prisoner's sentence, or at least be there when it ends.
16. Wait for the sentence to expire. Proceed to final step once it has
    expired.
17. Return all temporarily confiscated goods.
18. Allow the prisoner to leave Security. Set the prisoner's status to
    "released" or "patrolled" depending on their conviction or there
    lack-of.

### Prisoner Expectations

As a prisoner, you are expected to abide by certain standards. Failure
to obey will result in further punishment such as solitary confinement
or more brig time.

-   If you are incarcerated, do not attempt escape.
-   Irritating officers for amusement is a generally poor idea. Refrain
    from repeatedly banging upon windows.
-   Attempts at suicide will be met with solitary confinement. (( Also
    probably a server ban. ))
-   If you feel you have been unjustly incarcerated, contact the Warden,
    the Head of Security, Internal Affairs, or Colony Director (in that
    order of first to last) to appeal your case.
-   <s>If you've been eaten, try not to squirm too much or you might get
    gurgled!</s>

### Prisoner Rights

As a prisoner, you are entitled to certain rights under any
circumstance, regardless of the nature of your crimes.

-   All prisoners are entitled to a swift processing when being arrested
    and put into the brig. Longer than 1/4th of their sentence is
    considered a violation of this right so long as the prisoner is
    cooperating.
-   All prisoners are entitled to medical examination and aid if
    requested.
-   All prisoners are entitled to speak to an [Internal Affairs
    Agent](/wiki/Internal_Affairs_Agent "wikilink") for legal defense if
    requested.
-   All prisoners are entitled to be allowed to send fax to Central
    Command if requested.
-   All prisoners are entitled to food and water if requested.
-   All prisoners are entitled to be provided with clothing--preferably
    the standard orange prisoner jumpsuit and orange shoes.
-   All prisoners are entitled to safe and reasonable cell
    accommodations such as functional lighting, a place to sleep, and
    access to the brig's communal area if serving a sentence longer than
    20 minutes.

### Standard Security Gear

Aside from what the normal crew is allowed, this is what security should
be carrying under code green.

#### [Security Cadet](/wiki/Assistant "wikilink") / Security Conscript

Security cadets are just assistants who wish to pursue a career in
security. Security personnel should take these individuals under their
wing to educate them on Standard Operating Procedure, [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink"), and other tips on how to
do their job effectively and fairly. Security conscripts on the other
hand can be recruited by the Head of Security during an emergency, and
will have their ID temporarily changed by the Head of Personnel. Both of
these are allowed only the same standard equipment with some exceptions
listed below, but can be equipped to handle a variety of problems that
normal security is too preoccupied to handle.

-   Holotag to denote their active service. They must have at least a
    holotag, else they are not granted any other security equipment.
-   Red armband, if they are not issued a security uniform.
-   Whatever equipment is deemed necessary by the HoS depending on
    circumstance.
-   **No weapons are allowed for security cadets outside of code red or
    worse.**

#### [Security Officer](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink")

The gear available to security officers is available to all security
personnel under normal circumstances. Weapons of **all** kind should be
kept holstered and preferably concealed during code green. Brandishing
weapons openly tends to make the crew needlessly nervous and hostile
toward security personnel.

-   Security uniform or appropriate variant of security uniform. Red
    jumpsuits are acceptable substitutes.
-   Security softcap (Optional)
-   Standard Security helmet, kept in backpack unless responding to a
    call.
-   Standard Security armored vest
-   Standard Security HUD glasses or equivalent
-   R.O.B.U.S.T. PDA cartridge
-   Security belt
-   Security caution tape
-   Flasher
-   Pepper spray
-   Stun baton
-   Taser\*
-   Flashbang
-   Hailer
-   Minimum 1 pair of handcuffs
-   Universal recorder (Optional)
-   Basic First Aid supplies (Optional)
-   Emergency light source (flare or flashlight)

<sup>\*\ A\ stun\ revolver\ can\ be\ substituted\ for\ a\ taser\ without\ any\ special\ permissions.</sup>

With [explicitly written
permission](/wiki/Example_Paperwork#Weapon_Permit "wikilink") from the [Head
of Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") or [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"), *any* firearm may be carried
during code green by *any* personnel carrying a valid permit. However,
it is strongly recommended to never issue permits for automatic or high
powered weapons. The most common (and most reasonable) permit
distributed is usually for a common energy gun.

#### [Detective](/wiki/Detective "wikilink")

Although the detective's task is not to make arrests, they should be
prepared in case the situation arises where they must defend themselves
or arrest someone who is discovered at the end of an investigation over
a serious crime. In addition to the standard Security Officer gear,
there are some differences and additions. If two detectives are present,
this gear should be shared between them.

-   Detective attire in place of Security uniform.
-   Standard Security armored vest (optional)
-   Forensic Scanner
-   Black or latex gloves
-   Evidence bags
-   Universal recorder
-   Camera
-   .45 caliber or 9mm automatic handgun with LTL rounds.

#### [Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink")

The Warden has direct authority over the Brig, and is not usually
patrolling the station unless no other security is present on board, and
the crime being reported is serious, or the Warden themselves happens to
bare witness to the crime. Outside of the brig, they carry no special
authority, but within the brig, they get more flexibility. The Warden is
automatically authorized to use lethal force against anyone attempting
to break into or out of the brig or armory. For this reason, their
equipment when inside the security wing differs from while outside of
it.

-   Warden attire in place of Security uniform
-   Warden armored jacket (standard security armored vest is an
    acceptable substitute)
-   Box of handcuffs
-   While within the security wing, the Warden is authorized to carry
    any weapon available to them, excluding semi/fully automatic rifle
    caliber ballistics, or explosives, which are still forbidden. Pulse
    rifles are also forbidden.
-   Outside of the security wing, the Warden may only carry non-lethal
    weapons and munitions, as long as it fits in a backpack.

#### [Head of Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink")

When it comes to weapons, the Head of Security has the most flexibility
of all station staff, but their main job is to manage security and not
to be going around chasing criminals when there's normal officers to do
the main legwork. Notable exceptions are scenarios in which heads of
staff are threatened. The Head of Security also has the power to
deputize people during a crisis, and so, may have a valid reason to
carry multiple weapons at one time. As such, the Head of Security is
equipped with the best security gear available.

-   Head of Security attire in place of Security uniform.
-   Head of Security armored coat and hat (dermal patch is an acceptable
    substitute for the hat). It is arguably the best general purpose
    armor available.
-   While within the security wing, the Head of Security may carry any
    weapon(s) they please, excluding only explosives.
-   Outside of the security wing, one or more lethal weapons, such as an
    energy pistol, or any non-explosive weapon, so long as it fits into
    a backpack. At least one lethal weapon is recommended.
-   *At least* one ranged weapon for non-lethal engagement, such as a
    taser, or stun revolver, should also be carried at all times.
    Weapons with toggle-able fire modes between stun and kill (such as
    an energy pistol) are considered lethal weapons and should be
    considered as explained above.

#### [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink")

The Head of Personnel is **not** a member of Security and should *never*
be carrying any weapons aside from the energy pistol, baton, and flash
supplied to them for self defense. Permits by the Head of Security or
Colony Director may override this, but otherwise, they are in direct
violation of [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink")
§212, and should be charged accordingly. If a violation is made,
Security should also check if the HoP has illegal access on their ID,
because that is most likely how they obtained the weapon. Just because
they *can* give themselves all-access doesn't mean they are *allowed* to
outside of an emergency.

As an Acting Director, the Head of Personnel *may* legally carry a wider
variety of firearms, but this is heavily discouraged.

#### [Colony Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink")

Because the Colony Director is in charge of the station, it is
recommended that the Colony Director *some* kind of weapon at all times.
The Colony Director is an obvious target for hostile elements, and
should not be helpless in a fight. Different colony directors have
different preferences depending on their background. Some Colony
Directors enjoy the symbolism of a sword, while others prefer the
practicality of a firearm, but in any case, the policy and regulations
are the same.

-   No more than **one** non-explosive lethal weapon is permitted for
    self-defense. However, possession of *additional* weapons (excluding
    standard issue energy pistol or equivalent) is considered a
    violation of [Corporate
    Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §212.
-   A collapsible baton or stun baton are also both fine, but it is
    recommended that the Colony Director pick only one of these to
    carry.
-   Any body armor is permitted for the Colony Director to wear.
    However, wearing cumbersome body armor is not recommended, as the
    Colony Director's objective should not be to engage in extended
    fights, but rather, to escape them.

### Executions

-   Prisoner is informed of their punishment, and allowed to decide how
    they die (within reason). Suggested options include lethal
    injection, firing squad, <s>digestion</s> phoron gassing, or being
    exiled through the [Bluespace Gateway](/wiki/Bluespace_Gateway "wikilink")
    and given an exile implant so they cannot return.
-   Prisoner is to be granted a final request (within reason, because
    obviously "let me go" or "kill this dude for me" isn't reasonable).
-   Prisoner is given their last meal <s>like an assistant</s>.
-   Prisoner is escorted to the execution location under heavily armed
    guards, bound in a straight jacket and leg cuffs. Escorting officers
    are armed to kill. Lethal injections are done in medbay surgery room
    under supervision of doctor, firing squad is done on the shooting
    range, gassing is done in toxins or a room is built by engineering,
    etc.
-   It is required for the Colony Director to be present (**not an
    acting Colony Director**), or an execution may not proceed.
-   For an individual to be executed without planetside cloning (and
    thus, stay dead, unless they have privately owned cloning
    equipment), Central Command must make their own judgements. This is
    extremely rare in Virgo and usually only occurs in cases of
    terrorism. Central Command must be faxed prior to the execution. If
    CentCom chooses to commute it to another sentence, exonerate it
    entirely, or even pardon it, on-station security must comply
    immediately.
